# Simple Port Scanning

This directory contains basic TCP port scanning scripts for learning network security fundamentals.

## Scripts

### ipv4_tcp_portscanneer.py
IPv4 TCP port scanner using Python's socket library.

**Features:**
- Tests TCP port connectivity on IPv4 addresses
- Uses socket.connect_ex() for non-blocking connection attempts
- Returns port status (open/closed)

**Default Configuration:**
- Target: 192.168.1.4
- Port: 443 (HTTPS)

**Usage:**
```bash
python ipv4_tcp_portscanneer.py
```

**How it works:**
1. Creates an IPv4 TCP socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM)
2. Attempts to connect to the specified host and port
3. Returns 0 if connection succeeds (port is open)
4. Returns error code if connection fails (port is closed)

### ipv6_tcp_portscanner.py
IPv6 TCP port scanner for testing IPv6-enabled systems.

**Features:**
- Scans TCP ports on IPv6 addresses
- Uses AF_INET6 socket family
- Supports IPv6 loopback and remote addresses

**Default Configuration:**
- Target: ::1 (IPv6 localhost)
- Port: 443 (HTTPS)

**Usage:**
```bash
python ipv6_tcp_portscanner.py
```

**How it works:**
1. Creates an IPv6 TCP socket (AF_INET6, SOCK_STREAM)
2. Uses connect_ex() with IPv6 tuple format (host, port, 0, 0)
3. Checks return value: 0 = open, non-zero = closed

## Customization

To scan different hosts or ports, modify the variables in each script:

```python
# IPv4 example
host = "192.168.1.1"  # Change to your target IP
port = 80              # Change to your target port

# IPv6 example
host = "2001:db8::1"   # Change to your target IPv6 address
port = 22              # Change to your target port
```

## Learning Objectives

- Understand TCP connection basics
- Learn socket programming in Python
- Recognize differences between IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- Grasp basic port scanning concepts

## Limitations

- **Single Port:** Only scans one port at a time
- **No Threading:** Synchronous operation only
- **Basic Detection:** Simple connect scan (easily detected)
- **No Error Handling:** Minimal exception handling
- **Python 2:** Uses legacy Python 2 syntax

## Improvements to Try

1. **Port Range Scanning:** Loop through multiple ports
2. **Command Line Arguments:** Use argparse or sys.argv
3. **Threading:** Scan multiple ports concurrently
4. **Service Detection:** Identify services running on open ports
5. **Output Formatting:** Save results to file or JSON
6. **Python 3 Migration:** Update print statements and syntax

## Security & Ethics

⚠️ **WARNING:** 
- Only scan systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Unauthorized port scanning can be illegal
- Some networks have intrusion detection systems that log scanning activity
- Use responsibly and ethically

## Common Ports to Test

- 21 - FTP
- 22 - SSH
- 23 - Telnet
- 25 - SMTP
- 53 - DNS
- 80 - HTTP
- 443 - HTTPS
- 3306 - MySQL
- 3389 - RDP
- 5432 - PostgreSQL
- 8080 - HTTP Alternate

## Troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" errors:**
- Port is closed or filtered by firewall
- Service not running on target port

**"No route to host" errors:**
- Target host is down or unreachable
- Network routing issue
- Check IP address is correct

**"Network unreachable" errors:**
- No network connection
- IPv6 not configured (for IPv6 scanner)
- Wrong network interface

## Next Steps

After mastering these basics, explore:
- Multi-threaded port scanners
- SYN scanning (requires raw sockets/root privileges)
- UDP port scanning
- Banner grabbing and service fingerprinting
- Using professional tools like Nmap
